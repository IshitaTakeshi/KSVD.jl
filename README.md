# KSVD.jl

K-SVD is an algorithm for creating overcomplete dictionaries for sparse representations.  

This package implements:

* K-SVD as described in the original paper: [K-SVD: An Algorithm for Designing Overcomplete Dictionaries for Sparse Representation](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~freddy/papers/120.pdf)
* [Matching Pursuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_pursuit) for representing signals using a given dictionary.

## Usage
